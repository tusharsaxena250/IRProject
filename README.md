# IRProject

# Working
An intranet-based mini-search engine.
Working with .txt files.
The loadDic.py is used to convert the files to a particular format.(In our case .txt files).
preprocessing.py and invertedindex.py are files to get our inverted index file.
Using the gui we can search for words in our files.
